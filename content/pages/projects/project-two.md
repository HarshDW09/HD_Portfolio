  SurveyForge transforms survey creation through AI-powered intelligence,
  utilizing the Gemini API to generate high-quality survey questions from simple
  research prompts. The application combines a React frontend with Node.js
  backend and MongoDB for flexible data storage, enabling real-time analytics
  and comprehensive insight generation. With seamless Google Forms integration,
  SurveyForge streamlines the entire survey lifecycle—from question creation to
  response collection and analysis—making sophisticated data gathering
  accessible to researchers, businesses, and individuals without specialized
  survey design expertise.
